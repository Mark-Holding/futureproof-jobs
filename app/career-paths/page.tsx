        "When I saw financial analysis roles increasingly being automated, I realized I needed to pivot. Instead of competing with AI, I chose to leverage my deep understanding of financial systems to oversee and ensure ethical implementation of AI in finance. I took specialized courses in AI ethics while working part-time, built a network in the emerging field, and positioned myself as someone who understood both the technical and human sides of financial AI systems.",
        "After 18 months of focused effort, I landed my first role as an AI Ethics Consultant for a major financial services firm. Now, three years later, I lead a team that evaluates algorithmic fairness and ensures regulatory compliance across multiple AI implementations. My career is now more secure than ever, and I'm helping shape how AI is deployed responsibly."

I enrolled in a UX design program with a focus on conversational interfaces, and started contributing to our company's automation strategy.",
